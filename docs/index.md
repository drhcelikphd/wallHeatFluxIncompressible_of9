# wallHeatFluxIncompressible utility for OpenFOAM v9
This utility originally published in [this](https://github.com/wyldckat/wallHeatFluxIncompressible) repository. I just made it work on OpenFOAM v9. Please refer to the original repository for theoretical details. Feel free to reach me in case of any compiling problem.
